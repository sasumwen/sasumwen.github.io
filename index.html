<br>I am a Graduate Research Student in Neural Networks and Deep Learning at the Mathematics and Computer Science Department of <a href="https://www.ulethbridge.ca/artsci/math-computer-science/graduate-students/">The University of Lethbridge</a>,
My research focuses on developing advanced ML algorithms to solve complex medical problems, specifically targeting brain MRI data for schizophrenia research. I have a deep interest in computational neuroscience, computer vision, and machine learning, where I combine domain knowledge to contribute to novel and impactful discoveries.<br><br> 

<br>Currently, my research focuses on developing a novel segmentation approach for brain MRI using hybrid machine learning techniques, such as Mask R-CNN, graph neural networks, and traditional algorithms like Otsu's thresholding and active contour models. My aim is to create a more precise and accurate way to identify regional markers in brain MRI data that relate to different stages of schizophrenia. This multidisciplinary approach integrates medical imaging, AI, and neuroscience to make strides in the understanding and treatment of psychiatric disorders.<br><br>
